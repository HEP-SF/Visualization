## Old material

### Compiling

Pay attention to use `Biber`, and not `BibTeX`, to compile the bibliography. Otherwise you will get `no \bibdata - no \bibstyle found` errors.

### IDE

#### TeXStudio

If you use TeXStudio, you can change the default bibliography engine in the application's settings.

#### TeXMaker
